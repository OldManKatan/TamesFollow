<h2>Tames Follow</h2>

<p>Are you tired of your faithful mount <i>unfaithfully</i> running off into the wilderness and getting lost? Have you hit your last nerve pushing uncooperative boars around? This mod can bring your stress level down! <b>Tames Follow</b> gives all tames the ability to follow or stay, which may be the solution to your problems!</p>

<p>This works especially well for a certain rideable friend (no spoilers) who really likes chasing anything that moves into terribly dangerous places.</p>

<p>This is a very simple mod that makes any tamed animal follow players, or stay in an area, like a wolf. This is achieved by interacting with them (default e), exactly like a wolf. I'm sorry, this mod will remove the pet command, so our pets can't tell us that they love us anymore. I like to think that they show their love instead, by dutifully following you when you ask, and not running away!</p>

<p>Tested and confirmed working in multiplayer on a dedicated server. Due to the simplicity and implementation of the mod, I would be really surprised if it had any interactions with other mods.</p>
